Problem: 
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.


Solution:
delete p1 from person p1,person p2
where p1.email = p2.email and p1.id>p2.id;


// Explanation:
The above question asks us to delete the duplicate email entries from a given database, also it specifies to delete it from the database itself by using "delete" command
and not using "select".
So in order to do so I have taken two alias of the same table(database) such as 'p1' and 'p2' so that I can compare the enteries of the given table with itself.
The logic behind it is that wherever we find a same entry of 'email' in both the tables(alias p1 and p2) which don't have same id's we delete them from the database,
retaining the entry with the smaller 'id' value.
The deletion object is initialised as 'p1' and deletion is performed on 'p1' instance of the table, this helps in retaining the entry with a smaller 'id' value.
