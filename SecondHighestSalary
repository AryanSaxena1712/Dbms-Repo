//Problem Statement:
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table.


//Solution:
Select max(salary) as SecondhighestSalary
from emloyee
where salary<(select max(salary) from employee);

//Explanation:
Here, I have used nested queries, the first query select the max salary from the table which is smaller or less then the actual max salary of the table, which is the 
result of the nested query after the 'where' clause.
The nested query find the max salary of the table, the main query find the next greatest salary by compairing the result of the nested query (< max(salary)), which the 
highest salary of the whole table.
