//Problem Statement:
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

//Solution:
Select name from Customer
where name not in(Select name from Customer where referee_id=2);

//Explanation:
In the solution I have used nested query, where the subquery return the entries having 'referee_id' equal to 2. The main query selects the name from the table which are
not present int the result of the subquery.
