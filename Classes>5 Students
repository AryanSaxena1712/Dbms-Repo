//Problem Statement:
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

//Solution:
Select class from Courses
group by class
having count(student) >= 5;

//Explanation:
Here I have 'group by' and 'having' clause since group by select all the classes with same name such that 'count' can count the occurence of each class.
The 'having' clause checks for the existence of a class having count greater than or equal to 5, or simply having atleast five occurences.
