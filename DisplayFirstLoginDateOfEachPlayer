//Problem Statement:
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
Write a solution to find the first login date for each player.

//Solution:
select player_id,min(event_date) as first_login
from Activity
group by player_id;

//Explanation:
The problem asks us to select all the first login dates of the players, the database consists of multiple instances of players with their every login data.
In the solution we use "min" aggregate function which selects min date from the entries of date for each unique 'player_id'.
Since the question provides that the primary key consists of two prime attributes 'player_id' and 'event_date' so we use these to identify our result domain.
